# Fashion-MNIST-Classification-with-ANN
Fashion MNIST Classification with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Visualizations

This repository contains code for a project on building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model using the Fashion MNIST dataset available in Keras. The objective of this assignment was to create visualizations, compile the model, evaluate its performance on both training and validation sets, and use the trained model to predict the test data.

Objective:
The objective of this project was to build an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model using the Fashion MNIST dataset available in Keras. The assignment involved the following tasks:

Loading and exploring the Fashion MNIST dataset.
Visualizing the distribution of classes in the dataset.
Computing and visualizing the average image for each class.
Analyzing the distribution of pixel values across all images.
Applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data.
Building and training an ANN model using TensorFlow and Keras.
Evaluating the model's performance on both training and validation sets.
Making predictions on the test data using the trained model.
